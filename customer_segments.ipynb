Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension — how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new \"feature\" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.\n",

    "When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data — in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.\n",

    "Clustering is a techniques used to identify 'clusters' or groups of points in the data set. Allows you to visualize relatioship between points. The K-Means algorithm works in two steps, its assigns and optimizes. K Means optimizes by the min total quadratic distance of samples to the cluster center. K - Means chooses center randomly at the start, and then optimizes from there. The advantages to K - Means is that it is linearm, and very fast O(N). Workes well with circular data. A problem is that it starts with random choice, not very repeatable or conistsient. K Means is a local minimum algorithm. \n",

    "The guassian mixture model will assign probablilities to each point being in a spefic cluster, instead of assigning  a clear label. The problem with this algorithm is that it is not as easy or trivial as K Means, and is must higher cost. This algorithm relies on Expectation Maximization. Good for when you think there are hidden paramenters. \n",

When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the \"goodness\" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.\n",

    "In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships."

    "Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. *How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would reach positively to the change in delivery service?*  \n",

    "My recomendations would be different based on the segemnts. Obviously, Segement 0 spends alot of money on fresh food, therefore the 3 day delievry service would not be ideal as, fresh food is very important to be delivered everyday. These customers have a high chance of reacting negativly to this change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although segment 1, is much less likely to be affect by this change as much less of thier spending is on fresh, and more on other item that arn't necessarily affacted by time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above results, AB testing can be used by trying the new deliverty system with system, and not on segement 0 and see how the change affects. Based on the clusters, we would think that the change would negativelty effect segemnt 1, and indifferently affter segment 2. Cost can be saved with segment 2, but segment 1 might reutrns might outweight the benefit. "

    "Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  \n",
